       Intel(R) Distribution for LINPACK* Benchmark

===============================================================================

Package Contents 
----------------

This package contains Intel(R) Distribution for LINPACK Benchmark.
It is optimized for Intel(R) Xeon(R) and Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) processors. 
First generation of Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) Product Family (codename Knights
Corner) is not supported.

Pre-built binaries linked with Intel(R) MPI are included in this package. 
In addition, Intel Distribution for LINPACK Benchmark binary linked with
a third party MPI implementation can be created using the Intel(R) MKL MPI
wrappers. 

The package contains the following files:

Blocking size (NB) recommendation
---------------------------------

Recommended blocking sizes (NB in HPL.dat) are listed below for various Intel(R) 
architectures:

Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processor X56*/E56*/E7-*/E7*/X7*                             : 256
Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processor E26*/E26* v2                                       : 256
Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processor E26* v3/E26* v4                                    : 192

Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) Processor 72*                                           : 336
Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processor supporting Intel(R) Advanced Vector Extensions 512
         (Intel(R) AVX-512) (codename Skylake Server)                         : 384

Building Intel Distribution for LINPACK Benchmark for third party MPI
-------------------------------------------------------------

After setting MPI environment, please run build.bat script in this directory.
"xhpl.exe" binary will be built after executing "./build.bat" script.

Building Intel Distribution for LINPACK Benchmark from source code
----------------------------------------------

Netlib HPL source code can be obtained from

    http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/

After extracting source code, 

1. Copy Make.Windows_Intel64 into HPL source code

     $> cp Make.Windows_Intel64 .

2. Edit Make.Windows_intel64 appropriately

3. Build HPL binary

     $> nmake -f Make.Windows_Intel64

4. Binary will be located in current directory
